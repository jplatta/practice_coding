# Some Notes on Hashes in Ruby

* A hash can also be called an associative array.
* A ruby has returns `nil` if a key does not exist.
* `=>` is called the "hashocket".
* You can use symbols as hash keys.
* Symbols are like strings without all the extra functionality, e.g. you can't `split` a symbol.
